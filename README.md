# HMPPS Delius Interventions Event Listener

## Getting started

### External dependencies

This application consumes events generated by the [Interventions API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-service). Since the Interventions [API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-service) (and [UI](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-ui)) have many dependencies, we do not attempt to run and configure these applications using docker-compose in this repository. Please see the documentation in the relevant repositories for instructions on how to get these services running.

It is important the Interventions API is run with the follow environment variable:

```
AWS_SNS_ENABLED=true
```

### AWS dependencies

The application uses [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) for local deploys. To get started run the local docker-compose.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Build and Run

Java 16 is required to build and run the application. Use of [jenv](https://github.com/jenv/jenv) is recommended. You may also have to tweak your default IntelliJ configuration to use the correct JRE. Run the application from the commandline or using IntelliJ e.g.

```
./gradlew bootRun
```
